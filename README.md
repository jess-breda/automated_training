# automated_training
Protocols written while in the Brody lab to facilitate or support automated training of animals on cognitive tasks. Active protocols are kept in a private repository, these are snapshot copies of some of the protocols I've written.


## Delayed Match to Sample (DMS2, DMS)
This protocol and curricula is to train animals on an auditory delayed match to sample (i.e. XOR) task depicted below with DMS2 being the most recent version of the curricula. See the [DMS2](/@DMS2/ReadMe.md) or [DMS](/@DMS/ReadMe.md) ReadMes for implementation level details.

## ServoTester
This protocol is written to test a hardware prototype used to enhance mouse shaping. Specifically, doors that rotate based off of trial state and animal action to block the answer ports.
