Protocols written while in the Brody lab to facilitate or support automated training in the Brody Lab


## Delayed Match to Sample (DMS)
This protocol and curricula is to train animals on an auditory delayed match to sample (i.e. XOR) task depicted below. See [@DMS/Readme.md](https://github.com/jess-breda/automated_training/blob/main/@DMS/ReadMe.md) for implementation level details.

## ServoTester
This protocol is written to test a hardware prototype used to enhance mouse shaping. Specifically, doors that rotate based off of trial state and animal action to block the answer ports.
