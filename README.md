# automated_training
Example protocols written to facilitate or support automated training in the Brody Lab


## Delayed Match to Sample (DMS)
This protocol and curricula is to train animals on an auditory delayed match to sample (i.e. XOR) task. 


See `@DMS/Readme.md` for implementation level details. 

## ServoTester
This protocol is written to test a hardware prototype used to enhance mouse shaping. Specifically, doors that rotate based off of trial state and animal action to block the answer ports.
