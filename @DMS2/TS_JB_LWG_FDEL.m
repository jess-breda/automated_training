% Training Section; Jess Breda; Light & Water Give (LWG); Full Delay (FDel)
% 
% This curriculum starts with light & water guided side poking, then it 
% moves into center -> side poking (still with guides and sa/sb sounds). 
% Once the delay between centered and side is the desired length (measured 
% by parameters of the exponential it's being sampled from) sounds are added
% and a sound rule is enforced by sequentially removing light and water
% guides.
%
% Stage 1: Poke Left
%   In left side port, light turns on and fraction of water reward is
%   delivered. Animals have to answer within wait_for_spoke_tup, otherwise
%   will move to next trial. ITIs are very long so that animal learns the
%   association between light/water 'give' and reward. There is control to
%   make sure no more water is given until animal drinks from the port.
%
% Stage 2: Poke right
%   Same thing as stage 1, but for the right side. Stage 1 and stage 2
%   alternate days until they are both completed (e.g. an animal can
%   complete stage 2 before they complete stage 1)
%
% Stage 3: Center to side with short, random delay
%   Now the animal know to follow light and water guides, we introduce the
%   primary motor patter. A light comes on in the center port to indicate 
%   trial availibility, followed by a light & water delivery in either the 
%   L or R side port. The delay between center poke and light/water give is
%   drawn from an exponential distribution with a mean of 400 ms. There are
%   no violations or sounds during this stage, and the ITI is back to
%   "normal" lengths of ~3 seconds. The possibly out comes are correct or
%   no answer. Poking in the incorrect (unlit) port is tracked as a
%   temporary error (also called "forgivness" or "always" in other 
%   protocols), but there is no feedback to the animal until the poke
%   correctly.
%
% Modification to stage 3 on 4/22 to see if a center L/R block structure
% might help an issue we are seeing with some animals not doing light
% guiding very well upon learning the cpoke. Similar to the rats, blocks of
% 20 L/R light guided trials. Once they are good at that, then the L/R will
% be random. Additionally turning on violations after the first (or
% second?) day depending on how n_days_stage is evaluated. This is kind of
% a blend of stage 3 and 4. If it works, will need to make things a bit
% cleaner.
%   
% Stage 4: Introduce violations & sa/sb during drink
%   Now the animal understands the basic C -> S motor program, we will
%   introduce a violation penalty if the animal pokes before the side
%   light/water give. This will play a sound for a timeout and the animal
%   recives no reward. If the animal does not violate, and they answer
%   correctly (either on the first try or after incorrect answers), they
%   will hear a "replay" of sa/sb sounds that match that side during the
%   drink period. The third possible outcome is "no answer" and can be used
%   to measure engagement.
%
% Stage 5: Grow delay
%   In this stage, we will grow the distribtuion the delay is being sampled
%   from to make space for sa/sb sounds. The min, tau (mean) and max of the
%   distribtuion will grow if the animal did not violate. The target growth
%   is min : 1, tau : 1.6, max: 5.3. All features from previous stages 
%   (violation penaly, drink "replay", temporory error, light and water 
%   give) are still in use.
%
% Stage 6: Introduce sounds
%   In this stage, sa and sb with a delay between and after will start to
%   play. The delay between the sounds will be sampled from an exponential,
%   but the min, max and tau will be adjusted to account for the length of
%   the sounds + post sound delay. All features from previous stages are
%   still in use.
%
% Stage 7: Remove light give (in progress)
%   In this stage, we will remove the light give so that animal will rely 
%   on the subtler water give, and/or the sounds. This can be done in two
%   ways (1) reduce the fraction of trials where light give is happening,
%   or (2) delay the light give over time. Reward structure is TBD 
%
% Stage 8: Remove water give (in progress)
%   Same as above, but with water.
%
% Stage 9: Require sounds (in progress)
%   Same as 8, but give is now really off and the animals are punished for
%   incorrect answers
