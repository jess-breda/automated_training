May be good to have a flag for PWM or DMS to use.

%%% HistorySection init/prepare_next_trial conditions

trial_history could keep track on if it was a match, or a non match trial
by pulling this information from SoundSection, or calculating it within 
HistorySection, like:

if DMS == True:
    if prev_sa.value == prev_sb.value,
        trial_history == 'match';
    else
        trial_history == 'nonmatch';
    end
end

%%% HistorySection delay_history versus fixation_history:

delay is just the time between the two sounds

fixation is the total time from cp to go cue going off, takes into 
account the time of the sounds and pre/post delays 


%%% HistorySection end_session

if DMS == True,
    add a line with match performance and non match performance

wil need to keep track of these variables above as well and calculate
during the prepare_next_trial
